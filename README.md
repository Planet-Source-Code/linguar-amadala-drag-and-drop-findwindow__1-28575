### Description

This is more for a programmer's tool then anything else.

It allows you to select a window on screen with the mouse using a cursor and a smaller image representing that cursor on the dialog (which disappears when you click on it and drag it, reappearing when you make a selection)
 
### More Info
 
The project was fairly simple to construct, you can easily add it to a new project by adding the form to the project. It's light weight and should be easy to follow.

I made a small joke of the api comments, so if you'd like simply delete them.

Author of the code inside is Allen Copeland, which is my real name.
